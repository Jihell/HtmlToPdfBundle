    Do you see any Teletubbies in here?
    Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?
    Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside
    on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it?
    No?
    Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store,
    because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
